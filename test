Python Engineers:




Understand the “memory hierarchy” and can still write generators in Python? I am looking for Python engineers to build a computational infrastructure for financial models. Work involves implementing computation models in Python along with building infrastructure in API, grid computing, data storage and access layers, graph computing, etc.

You need to have a strong grasp of computing fundamentals: data structures, algos, OS, programming languages. Fluency in Python and its ecosystem namely Pandas/Numpy and the rest along with standard tools of the craft. Experience with web services and Flask/Django ecosystem a plus. Along with an active github, also required is a Bachelors in Computer Science/ECE or other Engineering Discipline. Position is contract with possibility of becoming FT. 

Please send resume along with github
